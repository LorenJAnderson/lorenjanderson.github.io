I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [insert]. My work involves applying deep reinforcement learning algorithms to spacecraft control scenarios with the goal of implementing and testing the resultant models in physical spacecraft. I earned my [[PhD](https://apps.grad.umn.edu/programs/doctoral_register.aspx?p=1052000)] from the University of Minnesota in 2022.
