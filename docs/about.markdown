I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [insert]. My work involves applying deep reinforcement learning algorithms to spacecraft control scenarios with the goal of implementing and testing the resultant models in physical spacecraft. I earned my [<span style="color:rgb(058,147,195)">PhD from the University of Minnesota</span>](https://apps.grad.umn.edu/programs/doctoral_register.aspx?p=1052000) in 2022.
